<H1>O God, you are a loving Father, Full of wisdom and knowledge, you have created my mind, with all its faculties, Intellect, reason, Memory and understanding. At present, my place in your divine plan, is a student. The time has now come, when through this examination, I have to show, how much knowledge I possess, and how well, I know my subjects. Be with me, and all the other students. Help us, I humbly ask you, that we may not get confused, nervous or sick. Illumine our minds, that we may understand, the questions properly, and be able to answer them correctly. Bless all our teachers, parents, friends, and those who help us. AMEN</H1>
