<h1><font color="green">The float property</font></h1>
<p>In this example, the image will float to the left side of the text, and the text in a paragraph will wrap around the image.A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the world wide web. Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct uniform resource locator, enabiling browsers to retrieve these resources from aweb server and display them on the user device. A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are confused. For a user, a search engine is ajust a website such as google.com, that stores searchable data about other websites. But to connect to a website server and display its web pages, a user needs to have a browser installed on the device.
